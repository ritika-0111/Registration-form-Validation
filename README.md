# Registration-form-Validation    

This repository contains code for registration page with form validation.    

Form validation generally performs two functions:  
   *  Basic Validation − First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in.  
   *  Data Format Validation − Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.
